	Hello! Your survey score is {{final_score}}.

	<h4>	
	Try to answer this survey as many times as you can in the next few days. We recommend that you try to fill this out almost everyday or as often as possible.

What the score means to you:
</h3>
<br>
1-2 : Not happy. If you answered honestly and got a very low score, you’re probably seeing yourself and your situation as worse than it really is. I recommend taking the Depression Symptoms test (CES-D Questionnaire) at the University of Pennsylvania’s “Authentic Happiness” Testing Center. You’ll have to register, but this is beneficial because there are a lot of good tests there and you can re-take them later and compare your scores.
<br>
<br>
2-3 : Somewhat unhappy. Try some of the exercises on this site like the Gratitude Journal & Gratitude Lists, or the Gratitude Visit; or take a look at the “Authentic Happiness” site mentioned immediately above.
<br>
<br>
3-4 : Not particularly happy or unhappy. A score of 3.5 would be an exact numerical average of happy and unhappy responses. Some of the exercises mentioned just above have been tested in scientific studies and have been shown to make people lastingly happier.
<br>
<br>
4 : Somewhat happy or moderately happy. Satisfied. This is what the average person scores.
<br>
<br>
4-5 : Rather happy; pretty happy. Check other score ranges for some of my suggestions.
<br>
<br>
5-6 : Very happy. Being happy has more benefits than just feeling good. It’s correlated with benefits like health, better marriages, and attaining your goals. Check back – I’ll be writing a post about this topic soon.
<br>
<br>
6 : Too happy. Yes, you read that right. Recent research seems to show that there’s an optimal level of happiness for things like doing well at work or school, or for being healthy, and that being “too happy” may be associated with lower levels of such things.
